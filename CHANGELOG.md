# CHANGELOG

This is the first release of v3 of the Azure Native provider. v3 features significantly smaller SDKs because they contain each Azure resource only for one default Azure API version. In addition, all default API versions have been refreshed and some module names have been updated and disambiguated.

For a complete list of changes with guidance on how to upgrade, please see [this guide](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/azure-native/from-v2-to-v3/).
