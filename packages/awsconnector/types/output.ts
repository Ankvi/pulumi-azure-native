If you update a policy outside of the CFNshort stack template, you'll need to update the CFNshort stack with the changes.  +  Resource-based policies don't support out-of-band changes. If you add, update, or delete a policy outside of the CFNshort template, the change won't be overwritten if there are no changes to the policy within the template. For example, say that your template contains a resource-based policy, which you later update outside of the template. If you don't make any changes to the policy in the template, the updated policy in DDB won’t be synced with the policy in the template. Conversely, say that your template doesn’t contain a resource-based policy, but you add a policy outside of the template. This policy won’t be removed from DDB as long as you don’t add it to the template. When you add a policy to the template and update the stack, the existing policy in DDB will be updated to match the one defined in the template.   For a full list of all considerations, see [Resource-based policy considerations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/rbac-considerations.html).

Specify a virtual private cloud (VPC) security group if you want to submit other properties, such as ``StorageType``, ``StorageEncrypted``, or ``KmsKeyId``. If you're already using the ``DBSecurityGroups`` property, you can't use these other properties by updating your DB instance to use a VPC security group. You must recreate the DB instance.

If the ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property is an empty string or the ``AWS::RDS::DBInstance`` declaration has no ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, AWS CloudFormation creates a new database. If the property contains a value (other than an empty string), AWS CloudFormation creates a database from the specified snapshot. If a snapshot with the specified name doesn't exist, AWS CloudFormation can't create the database and it rolls back the stack. Some DB instance properties aren't valid when you restore from a snapshot, such as the ``MasterUsername`` and ``MasterUserPassword`` properties. For information about the properties that you can specify, see the ``RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot`` action in the *Amazon RDS API Reference*. After you restore a DB instance with a ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, you must specify the same ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property for any future updates to the DB instance. When you specify this property for an update, the DB instance is not restored from the DB snapshot again, and the data in the database is not changed. However, if you don't specify the ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, an empty DB instance is created, and the original DB instance is deleted.

     * Creates a configuration for DNS query logging. After you create a query logging configuration, Amazon Route 53 begins to publish log data to an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group.

If you create a query logging configuration using the Route 53 console, Route 53 performs these operations automatically. Create a CloudWatch Logs log group, and make note of the ARN, which you specify when you create a query logging configuration. Note the following: You must create the log group in the us-east-1 region. You must use the same to create the log group and the hosted zone that you want to configure query logging for. When you create log groups for query logging, we recommend that you use a consistent prefix, for example: /aws/route53/hosted zone name In the next step, you'll create a resource policy, which controls access to one or more log groups and the associated resources, such as Route 53 hosted zones. There's a limit on the number of resource policies that you can create, so we recommend that you use a consistent prefix so you can use the same resource policy for all the log groups that you create for query logging. Create a CloudWatch Logs resource policy, and give it the permissions that Route 53 needs to create log streams and to send query logs to log streams. For the value of Resource, specify the ARN for the log group that you created in the previous step. To use the same resource policy for all the CloudWatch Logs log groups that you created for query logging configurations, replace the hosted zone name with *, for example: arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123412341234:log-group:/aws/route53/* To avoid the confused deputy problem, a security issue where an entity without a permission for an action can coerce a more-privileged entity to perform it, you can optionally limit the permissions that a service has to a resource in a resource-based policy by supplying the following values: For aws:SourceArn, supply the hosted zone ARN used in creating the query logging configuration. For example, aws:SourceArn: arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/hosted zone ID. For aws:SourceAccount, supply the account ID for the account that creates the query logging configuration. For example, aws:SourceAccount:111111111111. For more information, see The confused deputy problem in the IAM User Guide. You can't use the CloudWatch console to create or edit a resource policy. You must use the CloudWatch API, one of the SDKs, or the . + Log Streams and Edge Locations When Route 53 finishes creating the configuration for DNS query logging, it does the following: Creates a log stream for an edge location the first time that the edge location responds to DNS queries for the specified hosted zone. That log stream is used to log all queries that Route 53 responds to for that edge location. Begins to send query logs to the applicable log stream. The name of each log stream is in the following format: hosted zone ID/edge location code The edge location code is a three-letter code and an arbitrarily assigned number, for example, DFW3. The three-letter code typically corresponds with the International Air Transport Association airport code for an airport near the edge location. (These abbreviations might change in the future.) For a list of edge locations, see 'The Route 53 Global Network' on the Route 53 Product Details page. + Queries That Are Logged Query logs contain only the queries that DNS resolvers forward to Route 53. If a DNS resolver has already cached the response to a query (such as the IP address for a load balancer for example.com), the resolver will continue to return the cached response. It doesn't forward another query to Route 53 until the TTL for the corresponding resource record set expires. Depending on how many DNS queries are submitted for a resource record set, and depending on the TTL for that resource record set, query logs might contain information about only one query out of every several thousand queries that are submitted to DNS. For more information about how DNS works, see Routing Internet Traffic to Your Website or Web Application in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide. + Log File Format For a list of the values in each query log and the format of each value, see Logging DNS Queries in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide. + Pricing For information about charges for query logs, see Amazon CloudWatch Pricing. + How to Stop Logging If you want Route 53 to stop sending query logs to CloudWatch Logs, delete the query logging configuration.

Configuring health checks makes sense only in the following configurations:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Non-alias resource record sets</b>: You're checking the health of a group of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs for all the resource record sets. </p> <p>If the health check status for a resource record set is healthy, Route 53 includes the record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.</p> <p>If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set.</p> <p>If the health check status for all resource record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource record sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Alias resource record sets</b>: You specify the following settings:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You set <code>EvaluateTargetHealth</code> to true for an alias resource record set in a group of resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A). </p> </li> <li> <p>You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to a non-alias resource record set in the same hosted zone.</p> </li> <li> <p>You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set. </p> </li> </ul> <p>If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set to be healthy and includes the alias record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.</p> <p>If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the alias resource record set.</p> <note> <p>The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a <i>group</i> of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type. In that configuration, associate health checks with all of the resource record sets in the group of non-alias resource record sets.</p> </note> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Geolocation Routing</b> </p> <p>For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the entire United States, for North America, and a resource record set that has <code>*</code> for <code>CountryCode</code> is <code>*</code>, which applies to all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy resource record sets in the following order until it finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The United States</p> </li> <li> <p>North America</p> </li> <li> <p>The default resource record set</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name</b> </p> <p>If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each <code>HTTP</code> server that is serving content for <code>www.example.com</code>. For the value of <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code>, specify the domain name of the server (such as <code>us-east-2-www.example.com</code>), not the name of the resource record sets (<code>www.example.com</code>).</p> <important> <p>Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Create a health check that has the same value for <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code> as the name of a resource record set.</p> </li> <li> <p>Associate that health check with the resource record set.</p> </li> </ul> </important>

This field is optional for tasks using the Fargate launch type, and the only requirement is that the total amount of CPU reserved for all containers within a task be lower than the task-level ``cpu`` value.  You can determine the number of CPU units that are available per EC2 instance type by multiplying the vCPUs listed for that instance type on the [Amazon EC2 Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) detail page by 1,024.  Linux containers share unallocated CPU units with other containers on the container instance with the same ratio as their allocated amount. For example, if you run a single-container task on a single-core instance type with 512 CPU units specified for that container, and that's the only task running on the container instance, that container could use the full 1,024 CPU unit share at any given time. However, if you launched another copy of the same task on that container instance, each task is guaranteed a minimum of 512 CPU units when needed. Moreover, each container could float to higher CPU usage if the other container was not using it. If both tasks were 100% active all of the time, they would be limited to 512 CPU units. On Linux container instances, the Docker daemon on the container instance uses the CPU value to calculate the relative CPU share ratios for running containers. For more information, see [CPU share constraint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#cpu-share-constraint) in the Docker documentation. The minimum valid CPU share value that the Linux kernel allows is 2. However, the CPU parameter isn't required, and you can use CPU values below 2 in your container definitions. For CPU values below 2 (including null), the behavior varies based on your Amazon ECS container agent version:  +   *Agent versions less than or equal to 1.1.0:* Null and zero CPU values are passed to Docker as 0, which Docker then converts to 1,024 CPU shares. CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 1, which the Linux kernel converts to two CPU shares.  +   *Agent versions greater than or equal to 1.2.0:* Null, zero, and CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 2.   On Windows container instances, the CPU limit is enforced as an absolute limit, or a quota. Windows containers only have access to the specified amount of CPU that's described in the task definition. A null or zero CPU value is passed to Docker as ``0``, which Windows interprets as 1% of one CPU.

By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon uses. However, the container may use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver with this parameter in the container definition. To use a different logging driver for a container, the log system must be configured properly on the container instance (or on a different log server for remote logging options). For more information on the options for different supported log drivers, see [Configure logging drivers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/) in the Docker documentation.  Amazon ECS currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available to the Docker daemon (shown in the [LogConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_LogConfiguration.html) data type). Additional log drivers may be available in future releases of the Amazon ECS container agent.  This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log in to your container instance and run the following command: ``sudo docker version --format '{{.Server.APIVersion}}'``   The Amazon ECS container agent running on a container instance must register the logging drivers available on that instance with the ``ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS`` environment variable before containers placed on that instance can use these log configuration options. For more information, see [Amazon ECS Container Agent Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*. The ``LogConfiguration`` property specifies log configuration options to send to a custom log driver for the container.

For more information, see [Rolling update](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-type-ecs.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide* The deployment circuit breaker can only be used for services using the rolling update (``ECS``) deployment type.  The *deployment circuit breaker* determines whether a service deployment will fail if the service can't reach a steady state. If it is turned on, a service deployment will transition to a failed state and stop launching new tasks. You can also configure Amazon ECS to roll back your service to the last completed deployment after a failure.

If a service is using either the blue/green (``CODE_DEPLOY``) or ``EXTERNAL`` deployment types and tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the *maximum percent* value is set to the default value and is used to define the upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service that remain in the ``RUNNING`` state while the container instances are in the ``DRAINING`` state.

This parameter enables you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if your service has a ``desiredCount`` of four tasks and a ``minimumHealthyPercent`` of 50%, the service scheduler may stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks.  For services that *do not* use a load balancer, the following should be noted:  +  A service is considered healthy if all essential containers within the tasks in the service pass their health checks.  +  If a task has no essential containers with a health check defined, the service scheduler will wait for 40 seconds after a task reaches a ``RUNNING`` state before the task is counted towards the minimum healthy percent total.  +  If a task has one or more essential containers with a health check defined, the service scheduler will wait for the task to reach a healthy status before counting it towards the minimum healthy percent total. A task is considered healthy when all essential containers within the task have passed their health checks.

     * If you provide a list of instance types to use, you can specify the number of capacity units provided by each instance type in terms of virtual CPUs, memory, storage, throughput, or other relative performance characteristic. When a Spot or On-Demand Instance is launched, the capacity units count toward the desired capacity. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches instances until the desired capacity is totally fulfilled, even if this results in an overage. For example, if there are two units remaining to fulfill capacity, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can only launch an instance with a ``WeightedCapacity`` of five units, the instance is launched, and the desired capacity is exceeded by three units. For more information, see [Configure instance weighting for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-mixed-instances-groups-instance-weighting.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*. Value must be in the range of 1-999.  If you specify a value for ``WeightedCapacity`` for one instance type, you must specify a value for ``WeightedCapacity`` for all of them.  Every Auto Scaling group has three size parameters (``DesiredCapacity``, ``MaxSize``, and ``MinSize``). Usually, you set these sizes based on a specific number of instances. However, if you configure a mixed instances policy that defines weights for the instance types, you must specify these sizes with the same units that you use for weighting instances.

This is a static mapping strategy.  +  For containers in a task with the ``bridge`` network mode, the Amazon ECS agent finds open host ports from the default ephemeral range and passes it to docker to bind them to the container ports.    +  The ``containerPortRange`` valid values are between 1 and 65535.  +  A port can only be included in one port mapping per container.  +  You cannot specify overlapping port ranges.  +  The first port in the range must be less than last port in the range.  +  Docker recommends that you turn off the docker-proxy in the Docker daemon config file when you have a large number of ports. For more information, see [Issue #11185](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/11185) on the Github website. For information about how to turn off the docker-proxy in the Docker daemon config file, see [Docker daemon](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/bootstrap_container_instance.html#bootstrap_docker_daemon) in the *Amazon ECS Developer Guide*.   You can call [DescribeTasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeTasks.html) to view the ``hostPortRange`` which are the host ports that are bound to the container ports.

     * The port number on the container instance to reserve for your container. If you specify a ``containerPortRange``, leave this field empty and the value of the ``hostPort`` is set as follows:  +  For containers in a task with the ``awsvpc`` network mode, the ``hostPort`` is set to the same value as the ``containerPort``. This is a static mapping strategy.  +  For containers in a task with the ``bridge`` network mode, the Amazon ECS agent finds open ports on the host and automatically binds them to the container ports. This is a dynamic mapping strategy.   If you use containers in a task with the ``awsvpc`` or ``host`` network mode, the ``hostPort`` can either be left blank or set to the same value as the ``containerPort``. If you use containers in a task with the ``bridge`` network mode, you can specify a non-reserved host port for your container port mapping, or you can omit the ``hostPort`` (or set it to ``0``) while specifying a ``containerPort`` and your container automatically receives a port in the ephemeral port range for your container instance operating system and Docker version. The default ephemeral port range for Docker version 1.6.0 and later is listed on the instance under ``/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range``. If this kernel parameter is unavailable, the default ephemeral port range from 49153 through 65535 (Linux) or 49152 through 65535 (Windows) is used. Do not attempt to specify a host port in the ephemeral port range as these are reserved for automatic assignment. In general, ports below 32768 are outside of the ephemeral port range. The default reserved ports are 22 for SSH, the Docker ports 2375 and 2376, and the Amazon ECS container agent ports 51678-51680. Any host port that was previously specified in a running task is also reserved while the task is running. That is, after a task stops, the host port is released. The current reserved ports are displayed in the ``remainingResources`` of [DescribeContainerInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeContainerInstances.html) output. A container instance can have up to 100 reserved ports at a time. This number includes the default reserved ports. Automatically assigned ports aren't included in the 100 reserved ports quota.

In a CFNshort template, you can provide the policy in JSON or YAML format because CFNshort converts YAML to JSON before submitting it to DDB. For more information about resource-based policies, see [Using resource-based policies for](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/access-control-resource-based.html) and [Resource-based policy examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/rbac-examples.html). Creates or updates a resource-based policy document that contains the permissions for DDB resources, such as a table, its indexes, and stream. Resource-based policies let you define access permissions by specifying who has access to each resource, and the actions they are allowed to perform on each resource.

While defining resource-based policies in your CFNshort templates, the following considerations apply:  +  The maximum size supported for a resource-based policy document in JSON format is 20 KB. DDB counts whitespaces when calculating the size of a policy against this limit.   +  Resource-based policies don't support [drift detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift.html#). If you update a policy outside of the CFNshort stack template, you'll need to update the CFNshort stack with the changes.  +  Resource-based policies don't support out-of-band changes. If you add, update, or delete a policy outside of the CFNshort template, the change won't be overwritten if there are no changes to the policy within the template. For example, say that your template contains a resource-based policy, which you later update outside of the template. If you don't make any changes to the policy in the template, the updated policy in DDB won’t be synced with the policy in the template. Conversely, say that your template doesn’t contain a resource-based policy, but you add a policy outside of the template. This policy won’t be removed from DDB as long as you don’t add it to the template. When you add a policy to the template and update the stack, the existing policy in DDB will be updated to match the one defined in the template.
